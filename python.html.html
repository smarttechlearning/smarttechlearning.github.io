		<center><h1><b><i>Core Python Tutorial</i></b></h1></center>
		
		<center><h3><b><i>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.<br>

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, <li> <a href="https://www.python.org/">click here for interpriter</a> </li> and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.<br>

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.<br>

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.<br>

 
<h2>Why to Learn Python?</h2><br>
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.<br>

Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:<br>

Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.<br>

Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.<br>

Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.<br>

Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.<br>

<h2>Characteristics of Python</h2><br>
Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −<br>

It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.<br>

It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.<br>

It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.<br>

It supports automatic garbage collection.<br>

It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.<br>

<h2>Hello World using Python.</h2><br>
Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.<br>

 
<b><h3>print ("Hello, Python!");</b></h3><br>
<li> <a href="https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/">click here for demo!!!!</a> </li>
<h2>Applications of Python</h2><br>
As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:<br>

Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.<br>

Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.<br>

Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.<br>

A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.<br>

Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.<br>

Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.<br>

Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.<br>

Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.<br>

GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.<br>

Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.<BR><br>
